# EDR Attack and Defend Home Lab

## Project Overview  
This **EDR Attack and Defend Home Lab** simulates real-world cyberattacks and endpoint detection using industry tools. The lab consists of:  

- **Ubuntu attacker VM** running **Silver** as the method of attack.  
- **Windows 11 defender VM** with **LimaCharlie** as the EDR solution.  

The goal is to execute attacks, monitor activity, and analyze detections to understand both offensive and defensive security techniques.  

## Objectives  
- **Set up the lab** with two virtual machines and proper networking.  
- **Simulate attacks** using Silver on Ubuntu.  
- **Deploy LimaCharlie** on Windows 11 for EDR monitoring.  
- **Analyze detections** and document key findings.
