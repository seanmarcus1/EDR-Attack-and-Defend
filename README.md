# EDR Attack and Defend Home Lab

## Project Overview  
This **EDR Attack and Defend Home Lab** simulates real-world cyberattacks and endpoint detection using industry tools. The lab consists of:  

- **Ubuntu Server attacker VM** running **Silver** as the method of attack.  
- **Windows 11 defender VM** with **LimaCharlie** as the EDR solution.  

The goal is to execute attacks, monitor activity, and analyze detections to understand both offensive and defensive security techniques.  

This lab will be completed using the guide by Eric Capuano: https://blog.ecapuano.com/p/so-you-want-to-be-a-soc-analyst-intro

## Objectives  
- **Set up the lab** with two virtual machines and proper networking.  
- **Simulate attacks** using Silver on Ubuntu Server.  
- **Deploy LimaCharlie** on Windows 11 for EDR monitoring.  
- **Analyze detections** and document key findings.
